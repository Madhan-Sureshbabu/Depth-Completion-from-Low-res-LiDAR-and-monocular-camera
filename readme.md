Project Plan:

0. A well-defined fixed training and testing split.

1. A general data loader. It can load various lidar input like 16 line, 32 line and 64 line. It can load multiple samples with multiple frames as each sample together.

2. A flatform to try different ways to fuse multi-frame lidar information, including the method part and evaluating part by using depth gt.

3. A comprehensive depiction about all related work, learning and non-learning.

4. A bench mark to compare with other works.
